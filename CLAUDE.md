## Architecture

### Core Concepts
[To be documented as architecture is established]

### Key Components
[To be documented as components are built]

## Coding Conventions

### General Guidelines
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Follow the principle of least surprise
- Keep functions small and focused
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Write tests for new functionality

### Code Style
[Language-specific style guides to be added]

### Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive names that reveal intent
- Avoid abbreviations unless widely understood
- Be consistent with existing codebase patterns

## Testing

### Test Structure
[Testing approach to be documented]

### Running Tests
```bash
# [Test commands to be added]
```

### Writing Tests
- Write tests for all new features
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Common Tasks

### Adding New Features
1. Create a feature branch from main: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2. Implement the feature following project conventions
3. Write tests for the new functionality
4. Update documentation as needed
5. Submit a pull request

### Debugging
[Debugging approaches and tools to be documented]

### Performance Optimization

## AI Assistant Guidelines

### When Working on This Project

1. **Understand Before Changing**: Read the relevant code and understand the existing patterns before making changes.

2. **Maintain Consistency**: Follow the established patterns and conventions in the codebase.

3. **Test Your Changes**: Ensure any changes are properly tested and don't break existing functionality.

4. **Document Decisions**: Update this file and other documentation when making architectural decisions.

5. **Ask When Uncertain**: If requirements are ambiguous or you're unsure about an approach, ask for clarification.

## Notes for AI Assistants

- This is an evolving document. Keep it updated as the project grows.
- When you add new patterns or make architectural decisions, document them here.
- If you encounter repeated questions or issues, add them to the relevant sections.
- Keep this file concise and actionable - it should be a quick reference, not a novel.
